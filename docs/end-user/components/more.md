title:  Needs More Capabilities？
---

KubeVela is programmable, it can be extended easily with [definition](../../getting-started/definition). You have the following ways to discover and extend the platform.

## Learn more built-in capabilities

There're many out-of-box capabilities installed along with KubeVela controller, refer to the following links to learn more details:

  - [Built-in Component Reference](./references)
  - [Built-in Trait Reference](../traits/references)
  - [Built-in Policy Reference](../policies/references)
  - [Built-in Workflow Step Reference](../workflow/built-in-workflow-defs)

## Extend by Managing Addons

Installing addon from the community is also one of the most important way to discover more capabilities.

### List Addons

KubeVela community has maintained a growing [catalog of addons](https://github.com/kubevela/catalog) which will be synced to the default addon registry (https://addons.kubevela.net). You can use vela command line to list all available addons by:

```shell
vela addon list
```

The command will show the basic addon info along with all available versions.

```console
NAME                            REGISTRY        DESCRIPTION                                                                                             AVAILABLE-VERSIONS              STATUS

...snip...
```

* You can refer to [addon reference docs](../../reference/addons/overview) for more details of these community certificated addons.

### Install Addon

The simplest command for installing one addon is:

```shell
vela addon enable fluxcd
```

The expected output should be:
```console
I0111 21:45:24.553174   89345 apply.go:106] "creating object" name="addon-fluxcd" resource="core.oam.dev/v1beta1, Kind=Application"
I0111 21:45:25.258914   89345 apply.go:106] "creating object" name="helm" resource="core.oam.dev/v1beta1, Kind=ComponentDefinition"
I0111 21:45:25.342731   89345 apply.go:106] "creating object" name="kustomize-json-patch" resource="core.oam.dev/v1beta1, Kind=TraitDefinition"
I0111 21:45:25.382201   89345 apply.go:106] "creating object" name="kustomize-patch" resource="core.oam.dev/v1beta1, Kind=TraitDefinition"
I0111 21:45:25.411723   89345 apply.go:106] "creating object" name="kustomize" resource="core.oam.dev/v1beta1, Kind=ComponentDefinition"
I0111 21:45:25.625815   89345 apply.go:106] "creating object" name="kustomize-strategy-merge" resource="core.oam.dev/v1beta1, Kind=TraitDefinition"
I0111 21:45:25.660129   89345 apply.go:106] "creating object" name="component-uischema-helm" resource="/v1, Kind=ConfigMap"
Addon: fluxcd enabled Successfully.
```

You can also install addons with some advanced flags.

* Choose one specific version by adding `--version` flag in this command. e.g:

```shell
vela addon enable fluxcd --version=1.0.0
```

* Choose specific clusters for installation. You can use `--cluster` flag to choose specific clusters. e.g:

```shell
vela addon enable <addon-name> --clusters={cluster1,cluster2}
```

By default, the place for installation is specified as control plane cluster or managed cluster inside the metadata of addon. 

* Some addons support setting parts of parameter while enabling. For example `velaux` addon supports change image repository by setting `repo` parameter, then you can change the repo address to your own. e.g:

```shell
vela addon enable velaux repo=<your repo address>
```

### Get addon info

If you want to check the detail status of an addon, or get more available parameters and other useful info of an addon, you can use command `addon status`. For example:

```shell
$ vela addon enable velaux --verbose
velaux: disabled

As above shows, these infos contain the available parameters, available versions, dependent addons and description of and addon.

### Discover the capabilities installed

Once addon installed, end user can discover and use these capabilities immediately.

* Generally, end user can list the new component or trait types added by `vela component` or `vela trait`. Refer to [Lifecycle of a Definition](../../getting-started/definition#lifecycle-of-a-definition) for more usage details.

* You can also check the capability details of [community addon docs](../../reference/addons/overview).

### Uninstall Addon

:::danger
Please make sure the addon along with its capabilities is no longer used in any of your applications before uninstalling it.
:::

```shell
vela addon disable fluxcd
```

Expect output:
```
Successfully disable addon:fluxcd
```

### Manage Addon Registry

You can also manage the addon registries, such as adding/deleting your private addon registry.
Let's take the experimental community registry as example.

* List your current registries

```
$ vela addon registry list 
Name            Type    URL                        
KubeVela        helm    https://addons.kubevela.net
```

* Add a new registry

```
$ vela addon registry add experimental --type=helm --endpoint=https://addons.kubevela.net/experimental/
Successfully add an addon registry experimental
```

* Delete one registry

```
$ vela addon registry delete experimental
Successfully delete an addon registry experimental
```

* Build custom registry

  You can use ChartMuseum to build your custom addon registry. We have a ChartMuseum addon available. Please refer to [*Build your Own Registry*](../../platform-engineers/addon/addon-registry) for details.

### Air-Gapped Installation for Addon

If your cluster network cannot connect to the community addon registry you can: 
- build your custom addon registry. Please refer to [*Build your Own Registry*](../../platform-engineers/addon/addon-registry) for details.
- enable an addon from a local directory. Example:

```shell
$ tree velaux -L 1
velaux
├── metadata.yaml
├── readme_cn.md
├── readme.md
├── resources
├── schemas
└── template.yaml

2 directories, 4 files

$ vela addon enable ./velaux
Addon: velaux enabled successfully
```

Please notice that, while an addon is being installed in a cluster, it maybe still need pull some images or Helm Charts. If your cluster cannot reach these resources please refer [docs](../../platform-engineers/system-operation/enable-addon-offline) to complete installation without Internet access.

### Manage the addon with UI Console

If you have installed [VelaUX](../../reference/addons/velaux) which is also one of the addon, you can manage it directly on the UI console with admin privileges.

![addon list](https://static.kubevela.net/images/1.3/addon-list.jpg)

In the addon list, you can get the status of the addon and other info. Click the addon name could open the addon detail page, you can get the version list, definitions provided by the addon, and the readme message.

![addon detail](https://static.kubevela.net/images/1.3/addon-detail.jpg)

Select a version and deployed clusters, you can click the enable button to install this addon. You can check detail information in this section include:

- Definitions: The extension capabilities provided by the addon may include component, trait, etc.
- README: Addon description, explain the capabilities and related information.

For enabled addons, if no applications to use definitions, you can click the disable button to uninstall it.

### Make your own addon

If you're a system infra or operator, you can refer to extension documents to learn how to [make your own addon and registry](../../platform-engineers/addon/intro), including [extend cloud resources by addon](../../platform-engineers/addon/terraform).

## Extend KubeVela as a Developer

If you're extremely interested in KubeVela, you can also extend more features as a developer.

- KubeVela use CUE as it's core engine, [learn Manage Definition with CUE](../../platform-engineers/cue/basic) and try to extend capabilities with definitions.
- Read the [developer guide](../../contributor/overview) to learn how to contribute and extend capabilities for KubeVela.

Welcome to join the KubeVela community! We're eager to see you to contribute your extension.
