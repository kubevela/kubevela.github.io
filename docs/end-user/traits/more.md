```shell

`--discover` means list components from registry

Then you can install a trait like:

```shell
$ vela trait get init-container
Getting component definition from registry: default
Installing component: init-container
Successfully install trait: init-container
```

## 2. Designed by yourself

* Read [how to edit definitions](../../platform-engineers/cue/definition-edit) to build your own capability from existing ones.
* [Build your own capability from scratch](../../platform-engineers/cue/advanced)
  and learn more features about how to [define custom traits](../../platform-engineers/traits/customize-trait).
