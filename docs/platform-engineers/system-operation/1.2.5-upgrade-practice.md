title: Upgrade KubeVela from 1.1.5 to 1.2.5
---

## Introduction
This article is the operation manual for KubeVela to upgrade from 1.1.5 to 1.2.5 with deployed business applications. If you currently have no business applications deployed in KubeVela and no addons are enabled, you can directly refer to the official [upgrade document](https://kubevela. io/en/docs/v1.2/platform-engineers/advanced-install#%E5%8D%87%E7%BA%A7) to upgrade.

## Introduction to upgrade steps
### Preparation before upgrading
The following are the inspection items that need to be prepared before upgrading, you can compare them according to your actual situation
- 1.2.5 CRD, which can be obtained in [Official website source file](https://github.com/kubevela/kubevela/tree/v1.2.5/charts/vela-core)
- KubeVela[offline mirror](https://kubevela.io/zh/docs/v1.2/platform-engineers/system-operation/offline-installation) for offline deployment or using [velad](https:/ /github.com/oam-dev/velad)
- Custom Definition
### Check the KubeVela service
This step is mainly to check whether KubeVela is running normally. If the pod is not in a ready state, in theory, the automatic execution of the upgrade script should be prohibited. Manual intervention is required to fix the KubeVela running state first.

```
In addition, it is also necessary to check whether the status of the application and workload enabled by the corresponding addon is normal.
### update the CRD
Update the CRD of version 1.2.5 to the cluster, the CRD list is as follows
```shell
kubectl apply -f /path/to/your/crds/core.oam.dev_applicationrevisions.yaml
kubectl apply -f /path/to/your/crds/core.oam.dev_applications.yaml
kubectl apply -f /path/to/your/crds/core.oam.dev_componentdefinitions.yaml
kubectl apply -f /path/to/your/crds/core.oam.dev_definitionrevisions.yaml
kubectl apply -f /path/to/your/crds/core.oam.dev_envbindings.yaml
kubectl apply -f /path/to/your/crds/core.oam.dev_healthscopes.yaml
kubectl apply -f /path/to/your/crds/core.oam.dev_manualscalertraits.yaml
kubectl apply -f /path/to/your/crds/core.oam.dev_policydefinitions.yaml
kubectl apply -f /path/to/your/crds/core.oam.dev_resourcetrackers.yaml
kubectl apply -f /path/to/your/crds/core.oam.dev_scopedefinitions.yaml
kubectl apply -f /path/to/your/crds/core.oam.dev_traitdefinitions.yaml
kubectl apply -f /path/to/your/crds/core.oam.dev_workflowstepdefinitions.yaml
kubectl apply -f /path/to/your/crds/core.oam.dev_workloaddefinitions.yaml
kubectl apply -f /path/to/your/crds/standard.oam.dev_rollouts.yaml
```
### Execute the upgrade command
This step is the key step to upgrade KubeVela. The execution command is as follows
``` shell
helm upgrade -n vela-system --install kubevela kubevela/vela-core --version 1.2.5 --wait
```
### Enable addon
After the upgrade is successful, users can use the following methods to enable addonss if they need to be enabled
```shell
# View the list of addons
vela addon list
# Enable addon
vela addon enable xxx
```
⚠️Note: This step is not required if the addon is already enabled and used in the pre-upgrade version
### Update custom definition
After the addon is enabled, update the custom definition to KubeVela. If there is no custom definition, you can skip it, and the normal upgrade process is completed!
## Q&A
The following are the problems and solutions you can encounter during the upgrade from 1.1.5 to 1.2.5.
- Q: After upgrading from 1.1.5 to 1.2.5, the application status becomes workflowsuspending, and using workflow resume is invalid
- A: The reason is that rt already exists. Check the status of the application to see the specific reason. The solution is to delete rt and use workflow resume xxx.
- Q: How to solve the business application in workflow suspending state
- A: After the update, the status of apply changes to running, so if the status of the application does not affect the business process, it can be resolved automatically after the user operation is upgraded.
- Q: The application associated with the flux addon used, the status is always workflowsuspending
- A: This can only be restored by manually deleting rt and then executing vela workflow resume. Generally, it does not affect normal use. It can be restored during subsequent upgrades.
- Q: The rollout of the stock may fail to deploy the update components
- A: Solve by replacing the ownreferences of the stock controllerrevision and point the controllerrevision to the application
- Q: The updated definition file found that it did not take effect
- A: You need to modify the flux application, remove componentDefinition and traitDefinition
