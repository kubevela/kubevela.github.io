Kruise Rollout addon provides incremental delivery capabilities for Native Deployment, Kruise CloneSet, e.g. Canary Release, Blue-green Release, A/B Testing, etc.
For more details, please refer to: [Kruise Rollout](https://github.com/openkruise/rollouts/blob/master/docs/getting_started/introduction.md).

This article focuses on how to implement Canary Release using Kruise Rollout addon.

## Requirements

1. Install Kruise Rollout
```shell
% vela addon enable kruise-rollout
enable addon by local dir: addons/kruise-rollout
Addon: kruise-rollout enabled Successfully.
```

2. Please make sure one of the [ingress controllers](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/) is available in your Kubernetes cluster.
If not yet, you can install one in your cluster by enable the [nginx-ingress-controller](./nginx-ingress-controller) addon:

```shell
vela addon enable ingress-controller
```

Please refer [this](./nginx-ingress-controller) to get the gateway's access address.


## First Deployment

Deploy the application:

```shell
cat <<EOF | vela up -f -
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: canary-demo
spec:
  components:
  - name: canary-demo
    type: webservice
    properties:
      image: barnett/canarydemo:v1
      ports:
      - port: 8090
    traits:
    - type: scaler
      properties:
        replicas: 5
    - type: gateway
      properties:
        domain: canary-demo.com
        http:
          "/version": 8090
    - type: kruise-rollout
      properties:
        canary:
          # The first batch of Canary releases 20% Pods, and 20% traffic imported to the new version, require manual confirmation before subsequent releases are completed
          steps:
          - weight: 20
EOF
```

Then check the status of application will find out the application is running.

```shell
$ vela status canary-demo
About:

  Name:         canary-demo                  
  Namespace:    default                      
  Created at:   2022-06-09 16:43:10 +0800 CST
  Status:       running                      

Workflow:

  mode: DAG
  finished: true
  Suspend: false
  Terminated: false
  Steps
  - id:x6rnat7iby
    name:canary-demo
    type:apply-component
    phase:succeeded 
    message:

Services:

  - Name: canary-demo  
    Cluster: local  Namespace: default
    Type: webservice
    Healthy Ready:5/5
    Traits:
      ✅ scaler      ✅ gateway: No loadBalancer found, visiting by using 'vela port-forward canary-demo'
      ✅ kruise-rollout: rollout is healthy

```

Access the gateway endpoint with the specific host.
```shell
$ curl -H "Host: canary-demo.com" <ingress-controller-address>/version
Demo: V1
``` 


## Canary Release
Modify the webservice image tag, from v1 to v2, as follows:

```shell
cat <<EOF | vela up -f -
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: canary-demo
spec:
  components:
  - name: canary-demo
    type: webservice
    properties:
      image: barnett/canarydemo:v2
      ports:
      - port: 8090
    traits:
    - type: scaler
      properties:
        replicas: 5
    - type: gateway
      properties:
        domain: canary-demo.com
        http:
          "/version": 8090
    - type: kruise-rollout
      properties:
        canary:
          # The first batch of Canary releases 20% Pods, and 20% traffic imported to the new version, require manual confirmation before subsequent releases are completed
          steps:
          - weight: 20
EOF
```

The configuration strategy of kruise-rollout trait means: The first batch of Canary releases 20% Pods, and 20% traffic imported to the new version, require manual confirmation before subsequent releases are completed.

Check the status of applciation:
```shell
$ vela status canary-demo
About:

  Name:         canary-demo                  
  Namespace:    default                      
  Created at:   2022-06-09 16:43:10 +0800 CST
  Status:       runningWorkflow              

Workflow:

  mode: DAG
  finished: false
  Suspend: false
  Terminated: false
  Steps
  - id:8adxa11wku
    name:canary-demo
    type:apply-component
    phase:running 
    message:wait healthy

Services:

  - Name: canary-demo  
    Cluster: local  Namespace: default
    Type: webservice
    Unhealthy Ready:5/5
    Traits:
      ✅ scaler      ✅ gateway: No loadBalancer found, visiting by using 'vela port-forward canary-demo'
      ❌ kruise-rollout: Rollout is in step(1/1), and you need manually confirm to enter the next step

```

The application's status is `runningWorkflow` that means the application's rollout process has not finished yet.

Access the gateway endpoint again. You will find out there is about 20% chance to meet `Demo: v2` result.

```shell
$ curl -H "Host: canary-demo.com" <ingress-controller-address>/version
Demo: V2
```

## Canary validation successful, full release

After user verifies the success of the canary version through business-related metrics, such as logs, metrics, and other means, you can resume the workflow to continue the process of rollout.

```shell
vela workflow resume canary-demo
```

## Canary verification failed, rollback

If you want to cancel the rollout process and rollback the application to the latest version, after manually check. You can use this command:
```shell
vela workflow rollback canary-demo
```

Access the gateway endpoint again. You can see the result always is `Demo: V1`
```shell
$ curl -H "Host: canary-demo.com" <ingress-controller-address>/version
Demo: V1
```

## Rollout for helm component

This capability of rollout also can be used for helm component.

### First deployment

```shell
cat <<EOF | vela up -f -
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: canary-demo
spec:
  components:
  - name: canary-demo
    type: helm
    properties:
      repoType: "helm"
      url: "https://wangyikewxgm.github.io/my-charts/"
      chart: "canary-demo"
      version: "1.0.0"
    traits:
    - type: kruise-rollout
      properties:
        workloadType:
           apiVersion: apps/v1
           kind: Deployment
        canary:
          # The first batch of Canary releases 20% Pods, and 20% traffic imported to the new version, require manual confirmation before subsequent releases are completed
          steps:
          - weight: 20
EOF
```

This helm chart contain a deployment whose image is `barnett/canarydemo:v1`.

Please notice the `workloadType` configuration of kruise-rollout trait. You must tell the trait witch kind of resource in the helm chart want to roll out.

Access the gateway endpoint. You can see the result always is `Demo: V1`
```shell
$ curl -H "Host: canary-demo.com" <ingress-controller-address>/version
Demo: V1
```

### Canary Rollout

Update the target version of helm chart from `1.0.0` to `2.0.0`:

```shell
cat <<EOF | vela up -f -
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: canary-demo
spec:
  components:
  - name: canary-demo
    type: helm
    properties:
      repoType: "helm"
      url: "https://wangyikewxgm.github.io/my-charts/"
      chart: "canary-demo"
      # Upgade to version 2.0.0
      version: "2.0.0"
    traits:
    - type: kruise-rollout
      properties:
        workloadType:
           apiVersion: apps/v1
           kind: Deployment
        canary:
          # The first batch of Canary releases 20% Pods, and 20% traffic imported to the new version, require manual confirmation before subsequent releases are completed
          steps:
          - weight: 20
EOF
```

The only difference between two versions is image tag. Version `2.0.0` uses `barnett/canarydemo:v2`.

Access the gateway endpoint again. You will find out there is about 20% chance to meet `Demo: v2` result.

```shell
$ curl -H "Host: canary-demo.com" <ingress-controller-address>/version
Demo: V2
```

The other operations such as `continue rollout/rollback` are totally same with the operation for webservice component.
