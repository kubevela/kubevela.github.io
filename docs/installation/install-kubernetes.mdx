title: Install KubeVela in Kubernetes
---

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

### 1. Prerequisites:

- Kubernetes cluster >= v1.19 && <= v1.23

KubeVela relies on Kubernetes as a control plane. The control plane could be any managed Kubernetes offering or your own clusters, such as:

- Alibaba Cloud [ACK Service](https://www.aliyun.com/product/kubernetes)
- AWS [EKS Service](https://aws.amazon.com/cn/eks)
- Azure [AKS Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service)
- Google [GKE Service](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)
- Rancher [K3s](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/quick-start/) or [RKE](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases)

> Please make sure one of the [ingress controllers](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/) is available in your Kubernetes cluster.

### 2. Install KubeVela CLI {#install-vela-cli}

KubeVela CLI provides an easy to engage and manage your application delivery in command lines.

<Tabs
    className="unique-tabs"
    defaultValue="script"
    values={[
      {label: 'Script', value: 'script'},
      {label: 'Homebrew', value: 'homebrew'},
      {label: 'Download directly from releases', value: 'download'},
      {label: 'Docker', value: 'docker'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="script">

** MacOS/Linux **

```shell script
curl -fsSl https://kubevela.net/script/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows**

> Only the official release version is supported.

```shell script
powershell -Command "iwr -useb https://kubevela.net/script/install.ps1 | iex"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="homebrew">

**macOS/Linux**

Update your brew first. Please note that the brew method only supports the installation of the official release version.

```shell script
brew update
```

Then install KubeVela CLI

```shell script
brew install kubevela
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="download">

- Download the latest `vela` binary file via [release log](https://github.com/kubevela/kubevela/releases).
- Unzip the binary file, and configure the environment variables in `$PATH`, and you're done.

```shell script
sudo mv ./vela /usr/local/bin/vela
```

> [Installation Tips](https://github.com/kubevela/kubevela/issues/625):
> If you are using a Mac system, it will pop up a warning that "vela" cannot be opened because the package from the developer cannot be verified.
>
> MacOS imposes stricter restrictions on the software that can run in the system. You can temporarily solve this problem by opening `System Preference ->Security & Privacy -> General` and clicking on `Allow Anyway`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="docker">

If you have docker environment, you can easily run CLI with the vela CLI docker image called `oamdev/vela-cli`:

```
$ docker run --rm -it -v ~/.kube:/root/.kube oamdev/vela-cli version
CLI Version: master
Core Version: v1.3.4
GitRevision: git-1d823780
GolangVersion: go1.17.10
```

Refer to [using Vela CLI docker image](./system-operation/vela-cli-image) for more usage.
