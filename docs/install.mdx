title: Installation Overview
---

Here are available installation options depends on your environment:

### Don't have Kubernetes cluster yet?

For those who are new to KubeVela or Kubernetes, installing KubeVela in standalone mode is the best choice.
We developed [VelaD](https://github.com/kubevela/velad) for this purpose. VelaD package Kubernetes and KubeVela requirements to a single binary.
Please follow the document linked below to install KubeVela.

- [Standalone Installation](./installation/standalone): Install Kubernetes and KubeVela on local machine or a remote Linux server which you can access its IP address (Public Cloud or On-premise).

:::info
VelaD suits great for local development and quick demos, while we strongly recommend you to [install KubeVela with managed Kubernetes services](./installation/kubernetes) for production usage.
:::

### Already have Kubernetes cluster
- [Kubernetes Cluster](./installation/kubernetes): Install KubeVela in existing Kubernetes cluster.

:::tip
- For upgrading from existing KubeVela control plane, please read the [upgrade guide](./platform-engineers/advanced-install#upgrade).
