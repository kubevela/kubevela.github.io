Here are available installation options depends on your environment:

### Don't have Kubernetes cluster yet?

For those who are new to KubeVela or Kubernetes, installing KubeVela in all-in-one mode is the best choice.
[VelaD](https://github.com/kubevela/velad) is developed for this purpose. VelaD package Kubernetes and KubeVela requirements to a single binary.

- [Remote Server](./installation/install-remote): Install Kubernetes and KubeVela in remote server.
- [Local Machine](./installation/install-local): Install Kubernetes and KubeVela in local machine.

:::info
VelaD suits great for local development and quick demos, while we strongly recommend you to [install KubeVela with managed Kubernetes services](../platform-engineers/advanced-install#install-kubevela-with-existing-kubernetes-cluster) for production usage.

### Already have Kubernetes cluster
- [Kubernetes Cluster](./platform-engineers/advanced-install#install-kubevela-with-existing-kubernetes-cluster): Install KubeVela in existing Kubernetes cluster.

:::tip
- For upgrading from existing KubeVela control plane, please read the [upgrade guide](./platform-engineers/advanced-install#upgrade).
