- For Installation from existing Kubernetes Cluster, please read the [advanced installation guide](./platform-engineers/advanced-install#install-kubevela-with-existing-kubernetes-cluster).
- For upgrading from existing KubeVela control plane, please read the [upgrade guide](./platform-engineers/advanced-install#upgrade).

## 1. Install VelaD

[VelaD](https://github.com/kubevela/velad) packages KubeVela with all dependencies that enables you to run KubeVela on any of docker compatible environments or linux system.

- VelaD provides Kubernetes by leveraging [K3s](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/quick-start/) on linux or [k3d](https://k3d.io/) on docker environment.
- KubeVela along with all related images, and `vela` command line are packaged together that enables air-gapped installation.
- **VelaD suits great for local development and quick demos, while we strongly recommend you to [install KubeVela with managed Kubernetes services](./platform-engineers/advanced-install#install-kubevela-with-existing-kubernetes-cluster) for production usage**.

### Prerequisites

- Docker v20.10.5+ (runc >= v1.0.0-rc93) **or** Linux system

### Download VelaD

It will download and place the binary in your system `PATH`,
so you may be required for root privilege during the installation process.
If you don't need the automation with root access, you can download from the [release page](https://github.com/kubevela/velad/releases) and uncompress manually.

- ** MacOS/Linux **

```shell
curl -fsSl https://static.kubevela.net/script/install-velad.sh | bash
```

- **Windows**

> Only the official release version is supported.

Run following command in powershell:

```shell
powershell -Command "iwr -useb https://static.kubevela.net/script/install-velad.ps1 | iex"
```

Check `velad` and `vela` command line tools are exist in `/usr/local/bin/` for MacOS/Linux or `C:\vela\` for Windows.

### Setup

```shell
velad install
```

The expected output:

## 2. Install VelaUX

> This is optional if you don't use UI console of KubeVela.

VelaUX is a dashboard including UI console and API services.

```shell script
vela addon enable ~/.vela/addons/velaux
```

expected output:

```
Addon: velaux enabled Successfully.
```

By default, velaux didn't have any exposed port, If there is the browser in local, you can view it by:

```
vela port-forward addon-velaux -n vela-system 8080:80
```

Choose `> Cluster: local | Namespace: vela-system | Component: velaux | Kind: Service` for visit.

If you are installing it in a remote environment such as a virtual machine, you can refer to [VelaUX addon](./reference/addons/velaux) document to expose an endpoint or other advanced installation arguments.

VelaUX needs authentication. The default username is `admin` and the password is **`VelaUX12345`**.

It requires you to override with a new password for the first login, please make sure to remember the new password.

## 3. Cleanup

```
velad uninstall
```

This command will clean up KubeVela controllers along with the Kubernetes cluster, refer to [the advanced guide](./platform-engineers/advanced-install#uninstall) for more detailed steps.

## Next Step

- [Deploy your first application](./quick-start).
