title: Project management
---

Projects provide a logical grouping of applications、environments and targets, which is useful when VelaUX is used by multiple teams. Projects provide the following features:

* restrict where apps may be deployed to (target clusters and namespaces), we plan to support setting resource limits for the target.
* restrict what Integrations can be use(trusted Helm repositories, docker registry or cloud provider)
* defining project roles to provide application RBAC.
* restrict what kinds of objects or component definitions may or may not be deployed(TODO)

## The Default Project

Once installed VelaUX has one default project with name `Default`, and owner by admin user. At the same time, the default target and environment are also generated by default and bound in the project.

## Creating Projects

Users with project management rights can go to `Platform/Projects` page，in this page you could create and delete project.

Click the `New Project` button, you can open the drawer page for creating a project. Each project should set a name and owner, the owner user can auto grant the project admin role after the project is created.

## Updating Projects

Project owner, alias, and description information support updating. Click the project name and go to the project detail page, you can manage the members and roles in this project.

## Deleting Projects

If there are applications and environments in a project, it can not be deleted. you must delete applications, environments, and targets in the project that you want to delete.
