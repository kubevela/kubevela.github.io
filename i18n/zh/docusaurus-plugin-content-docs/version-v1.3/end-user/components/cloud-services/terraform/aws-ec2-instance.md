 root_block_device | Customize details about the root block device of the instance. See Block Devices below for details | list(any) | false |  
 secondary_private_ips | A list of secondary private IPv4 addresses to assign to the instance's primary network interface (eth0) in a VPC. Can only be assigned to the primary network interface (eth0) attached at instance creation, not a pre-existing network interface i.e. referenced in a `network_interface block` | list(string) | false |  
 source_dest_check | Controls if traffic is routed to the instance when the destination address does not match the instance. Used for NAT or VPNs. | bool | false |

 spot_instance_interruption_behavior | Indicates Spot instance behavior when it is interrupted. Valid values are `terminate`, `stop`, or `hibernate` | string | false |

 timeouts | Define maximum timeout for creating, updating, and deleting EC2 instance resources | map(string) | false |  
 user_data | The user data to provide when launching the instance. Do not pass gzip-compressed data via this argument; see user_data_base64 instead. | string | false |  
 user_data_base64 | Can be used instead of user_data to pass base64-encoded binary data directly. Use this instead of user_data whenever the value is not a valid UTF-8 string.
