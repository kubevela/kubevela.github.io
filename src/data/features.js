            KubeVela introduces Open Application Model (OAM) as the consistent yet higher level API to capture and render a full deployment of microservices on top of hybrid environments. Placement strategy, traffic shifting and rolling update are declared at application level. No infrastructure level concern, simply deploy.

            KubeVela has an UI Console along with other out-of-box capabilities from a large catalog of addons. It models application delivery as DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) and expresses it with CUE - a modern data configuration language. This allows you to design application deployment steps per needs and orchestrate them in programmable approach. No restrictions, natively extensible.

            KubeVela works as an application
            delivery control plane that is fully decoupled from runtime
            infrastructure. It can deploy any
            workload types including containers, cloud services, databases,
            or even VM instances to any cloud or Kubernetes cluster, following the
            workflow designed by you.</Translate>
