title:  Progressive Rollout RoadMap
---

Here are some working items on the roadmap

## Embed rollout in an application

We will support embedded rollout settings in an application. In this way, any changes to the
application will naturally roll out in a controlled manner instead of a sudden replace.

## Add support to trait upgrade

There are three trait related workitems that complement each other

- we need to make sure that traits that work on the previous application still work on the new
  application
- traits themselves also need a controlled way to upgrade instead of replacing the old in one shot
- rollout controller should suppress conflicting traits (like HPA/Scalar) during the rollout process

## Add metrics based rolling checking

We will integrate with prometheus and use the metrics generated by the application to control the
flow of the rollout. This part will be very similar to flagger.

## Add traffic shifting support

We will add traffic shifting based upgrading strategy like canary, A/B testing. We plan to support
Istio in our first version. This part will be very similar to flagger.

## Support upgrading more than one component

Currently, we can only upgrade one component at a time. We will support upgrading more components in
one application at once.

## Support Helm Rollout strategy

Currently, we only support upgrading k8s resources. We will support helm based workload in the
future.

## Add more restrictions on what part of the rollout plan can be changed during rolling

Here are some examples

- the BatchPartition field cannot decrease beyond the current batch
- the RolloutBatches field can only change the part after the current batch
- the ComponentList field cannot be changed after rolling starts
- the RolloutStrategy/TargetSize/NumBatches cannot be changed
