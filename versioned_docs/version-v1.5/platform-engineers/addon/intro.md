title: Make Your Own Addon
---

A KubeVela addon is a collection that can contain the following three types of files；
* `Basic information file` that contains `metadata.yaml` and `README.md`.
* `OAM module file` that defines KubeVela extensibility points, including [Definitions](../../getting-started/definition), [UI-Schema](../../reference/ui-schema) or [topology-rules](../../reference/topology-rule).
* `Application description file` that defines a KubeVela [application](../../getting-started/core-concept). Typically, a `Definition` of addon should be supported by a Kubernetes operator. The Kubernetes objects of this operator should be defined in a KubeVela application. After the addon is enabled, these resources will be dispatched to the clusters by KubeVela application controller.

The picture below shows what KubeVela does when an addon is enabled. There are mainly three process:
* [Addon Registry](./addon-registry) store addons which can be used to share and distribute addons anywhere, it can be any git repo or helm chart repository.
* When an addon is enabled through UX/CLI, it will pull these resource files from the Addon Registry, assemble them into a KubeVela application and apply it.
* Finally, the KubeVela controller take care the rest things and deliver the addon as a normal application to the clusters.

## Make an addon

To make an addon, you should follow some basic rules. You need to create an addon directory to place addon resource files.

Typically, the directory hierarchy is as follows:

```shell
├── resources/
│   ├── xxx.cue
│   └── xxx.yaml
├── definitions/
├── schemas/
├── README.md
├── metadata.yaml
├── parameter.cue
└── template.yaml(or template.cue)
```

You can use `vela addon init <addon-name>` command to create a basic structure of addon.

Not all of these directories or files are necessary, let's explain them one by one.

### Basic information file

> This type of file is required in an addon.

#### metadata.yaml

A `metadata.yaml` describes the basic information of an addon, such as the name, version, description, etc. With this file, an addon can be recognized by UX/CLI, an example is as follows:

```yaml
name: example
version: 1.0.0
description: Example adddon.
icon: xxx
url: xxx

tags:
  - only_example

deployTo:
  runtimeCluster: false

dependencies:
- name: addon_name

system:
  vela: ">=v1.4.0"
  kubernetes: ">=1.19.0-0"

invisible: false
```

Here's the usage of every field:

| Field | Required  | Type | Usage  |
|:----:|:---:|:--:|:------:|
|  name    |  yes | string | The name of the addon.  |
|  version    | yes  | string | The version of addon, increase for every change and follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/) rule.  |
| description     | yes  | string | Description of the addon.  |
| icon     | no  | string | Icon of the addon, will display in addon dashboard.  |
| url     | no  | string | The official website of the project behind the addon.  |
| tags     | no  | []string | The tags to display and organize the addon.  |
| dependencies     | no  | []{ name: string } | Names of other addons it depends on. KubeVela will make sure these dependencies are enabled before installing this addon.  |
| system.vela     | no  | string | Required version of vela controller, vela CLI will block the installation if vela controller can't match the requirements.  |
| system.kubernetes     | no  | string | Required version of Kubernetes, vela CLI will block the installation if Kubernetes cluster can't match the requirements.  |
| deployTo.runtimeCluster     | no  | bool | By default, the addon will not be installed in the managed clusters. If it's `true`, it will be delivered to all managed clusters automatically. (This field only take effect when application template file is YAML typed) |

#### README.md (Required)

The README will be displayed in the dashboard for end user who's going to install this addon. So you should let them understand the basic knowledge of the addon which contains:

* What is the addon?
* Why to use this addon? The use case and scenarios.
* How to use this addon? It is the `end user` who should understand. An end to end demo is recommended.
* What will be installed? The definitions along with the CRD controllers behind.

There is no restrict rules for an [experimental addon](https://github.com/kubevela/catalog/tree/master/experimental/addons), but if the addon want to be [verified](https://github.com/kubevela/catalog/tree/master/addons), the README is the most important thing.

### OAM module file

> This type of file isn't required in an addon.

#### Definition files (`definitions/` folder)

The `definitions/` folder is used to store `Definition`, which can be a YAML file of ComponentDefinition, TraitDefinitions or WorkflowStepDefinitions Kubernetes CustomResource. It can also be a CUE file that defines KubeVela [Definitions](../../getting-started/definition), which will be rendered into the corresponding Kubernetes objects and applied to the cluster when enabling the addon.

> Please notice: These definitions will only be applied to the control plane.

#### UI-Schema (`schemas/` folder)

The `schemas/` folder is used to store the [UI schema](../../reference/ui-schema) files corresponding to `Definition`, which is used to enhance the display effect when displaying the parameters required by `Definition` in UX.

### Application description file

> This type of file isn't required in an addon.

Through the above introduction, we know that the Definition of an addon usually should be supported by a Kubernetes operator. The operator should be defined in a KubeVela application and installed by KubeVela application controller. So the function of application description file is describing this application. Application description file contains two types of file: application template file (template.yaml or template.cue) and resources files which under `resources/` folder.

The content of a YAML typed file must be a Kubernetes object manifest, so you can use the simplest way to define a KubeVela application that may contain several components, policies, or workflow. If you choose to use CUE to define application description files the addon will have these abilities:

* Utilize the flexible and concise syntax of the CUE language, rich built-in functions and its parameter verification capabilities, to render and deploy the application and auxiliary resources with parameters and metadata of addon.
* An addon may contain multiple Definitions and CRD Operators, they can be selectively installed according to parameters of addon.

[YAML application description file](./addon-yaml) will introduce how to use YAML define application of addon.
[CUE application description file](./addon-cue) will introduce how to use CUE define the application of addon.

The above is a complete introduction to how to make an addon, you can find the complete description of the above-mentioned addon in [catalog](https://github.com/kubevela/catalog/tree/master/experimental/addons/example).

## Install Addon Locally

You can install the addon from local to debug your own addon:

```
vela addon enable ./your-addon-dir/
```

## Known Limits

- Cannot only install addon in the sub-clusters. Because of KubeVela need render out every kind of resource in control plane, if an addon contain some [CRD](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/), and these CRDs must be installed in control plane, otherwise Vela-core controller will meet an error of cannot find CRD.

## Extend Terraform Addon

*  We have built some tools to extend cloud resource as addons  for convenience, you can refer to the [extend terraform addon docs](./terraform).

## Contribution

In addition to uploading the addon resource files to your addon repository, you can also submit a pull request to KubeVela [community addon repository](https://github.com/kubevela/catalog/tree/master/addons) and [experimental addon repository](https://github.com/kubevela/catalog/tree/master/experimental/addons) to addon new addons. After pr merged your addons can be discovered and used by other KubeVela users.

Meanwhile, any bug fix of existing addons are welcomed. Just make a pull request to [this](https://github.com/kubevela/catalog) repo.
