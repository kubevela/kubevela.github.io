## Overview

This documents will show you how to install KubeVela in standalone mode. There are two options:

1. [Local machine](#local): Install on a local machine based on Linux, macOS or Windows operating system.
2. [Remote Linux server](#remote): Install on a remote Linux server with accessible IP address.

:::tip
Install KubeVela on a remote server with non-linux operating system is not fully tested.

### About VelaD

We'll use [VelaD](https://github.com/kubevela/velad) to install KubeVela in standalone mode. VelaD is a CLI tool that
packages KubeVela with all dependencies for minimal installation and VelaUX.
VelaD enables you to run KubeVela on any of docker compatible environments or Linux system.

- VelaD leverages [K3s](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/quick-start/) and [k3d](https://k3d.io/) to manage Kubernetes automatically. Users needn't care the details about Kubernetes.
- KubeVela along with all related images, and `vela` command line are packaged together that enables air-gapped installation of KubeVela and VelaUX.


:::caution
Installation with standalone mode is suited for development and testing purpose best that you don't even aware of the Kubernetes inside. If you want to use it in production, you need to understand and maintain the K3s for Kubernetes management well.

```

Choose `> local | velaux | velaux` for visit.

:::note
For more VelaUX options, refer to [VelaUX addon](../reference/addons/velaux) document for other advanced installation arguments.
:::

VelaUX needs authentication. The default username is `admin` and the password is **`VelaUX12345`**.

It requires you to override with a new password for the first login, please make sure to remember the new password.

### 4. Cleanup

This command will clean up KubeVela controllers along with the Kubernetes cluster, refer to [the advanced guide](../platform-engineers/advanced-install#uninstall) for more detailed steps.

```
velad uninstall
```

## Install on a remote Linux server {#remote}

This documents show you how to install KubeVela on a remote Linux server (e.g. aws EC2 or aliyun ECS) in standalone mode.

### 1. Prepare a machine

Prepare a Linux server, make sure it meets the following requirements:

**Requirements**

1. Make sure your machine have `curl` installed.
2. This server has a public IP, or you can access the server's IP if it's a on-premise server.
3. If you are using a cloud server, make sure you have opened the port 6443 in secure group.

### 2. Install VelaD and Setup KubeVela

#### Download VelaD

Following script will download and place the binary in your system `PATH`,
so you may be required for root privilege during the installation process.
If you don't need the automation with root access, you can download from the [release page](https://github.com/kubevela/velad/releases) and uncompress manually.

```shell
curl -fsSl https://kubevela.io/script/install-velad.sh | bash
```

Check `velad` installed in `/usr/local/bin/`

#### Verify Installation

Export kubeconfig and list all built-in ComponentDefinition:

```shell
export KUBECONFIG=$(velad kubeconfig --host)
vela comp
```

:::tip
- When executing `velad install`, vela CLI (`vela`) is already installed and add to `PATH` automatically. So you can use it directly.
Later we will access KubeVela on local machine, we will install vela CLI on local machine again.
- A file uesd to configure access to clusters is called *kubeconfig file*. Vela CLI also use this file to access KubeVela.

### 3. Install VelaUX

VelaUX is a dashboard for KubeVela. It is a web application that runs in your cluster. You can access it with your browser.

Run this command on remote server.

```shell
vela addon enable ~/.vela/addons/velaux serviceType=NodePort
```

<details>
  <summary>expected output</summary>

  ```
  Addon: velaux enabled Successfully.
  ...
  I0907 12:03:11.462606   98769 utils.go:156] find cluster gateway service vela-system/kubevela-cluster-gateway-service:9443
  Please access addon-velaux from the following endpoints:
  +---------+-----------+-------------------------------+----------------------------+-------+
  | CLUSTER | COMPONENT |   REF(KIND/NAMESPACE/NAME)    |          ENDPOINT          | INNER |

  +---------+-----------+-------------------------------+----------------------------+-------+
  ```

</details>

By adding `serviceType=NodePort`, we are telling VelaUX to expose service with K8s
[NodePort](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-nodeport) type.
Check the endpoint of VelaUX with following command:

```shell
vela status addon-velaux -n vela-system --endpoint
```

It will show URL like `http://PUBLIC-IP:PORT` access that URL with your browser.

:::caution open the port
If you are using a cloud server, please open this port in secure group.
:::
:::note
For more VelaUX options, refer to [VelaUX addon](../reference/addons/velaux) document for other advanced installation arguments.
:::

VelaUX needs authentication. The default username is `admin` and the password is **`VelaUX12345`**.

It requires you to override with a new password for the first login, please make sure to remember the new password.

### 4. Access cluster From Local (Optional)

You can access KubeVela with your local machine. Make sure you add `--bind-ip` when executing `velad install` command in the last step on the server.

#### Copy KubeConfig

Following command will print the kubeconfig for your cluster. `--external` means printed kubeconfig can be used from other
machine (like your local machine).

```shell
cat $(velad kubeconfig --external)
```

Then you need to copy this kubeconfig to your local machine. Let's say you saving a file in `~/.kube/velad-config` in your local machine.

#### Install Vela CLI in Local

To access the cluster, you also need to install `vela` CLI in your local machine.

```shell
curl -fsSl https://kubevela.io/script/install.sh | bash
```

#### Access KubeVela

Export KUBECONFIG environment variable and list all built-in ComponentDefinition:

```shell
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/velad-config
vela comp
```

### 5. Cleanup

Run following command on remote server.

This command will clean up KubeVela controllers along with the Kubernetes cluster, refer to [the advanced guide](../platform-engineers/advanced-install#uninstall) for more detailed steps.

```shell
velad uninstall
```
