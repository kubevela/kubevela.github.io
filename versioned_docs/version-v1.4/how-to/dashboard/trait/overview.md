After deploying an application, VelaUX will automatically bind a `scaler` trait to the application. You can update, delete or bind other traits in the dashboard.

> Note: You need to re-deploy the application after updating traits.

## Bind new traits

Click `New Trait` to bind traits for the application.

You can select different type of traits. In addition, addons can be enabled to enable more traits.
