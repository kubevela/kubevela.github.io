You can pick up any of the following ways you're interested to contribute.

## Contribute Use cases and Samples

* If you're using KubeVela, the easiest thing to contribute is to [credit the community](https://github.com/kubevela/kubevela/issues/1662).
* If you are interested, you can also write a [kubevela.io blog](https://kubevela.net/blog) to tell more about the use case.
* You can also contribute to [KubeVela Official Samples](https://github.com/kubevela/samples).

## Report bugs

Before submitting a new issue, try to make sure someone hasn't already reported the problem.
Look through the [existing issues](https://github.com/kubevela/kubevela/issues) for similar issues.

Report a bug by submitting a [bug report](https://github.com/kubevela/kubevela/issues/new?assignees=&labels=kind%2Fbug&template=bug_report.md&title=).
Make sure that you provide as much information as possible on how to reproduce the bug.

Follow the issue template and add additional information that will help us replicate the problem.

### Security issues

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, please read our [security policy](https://github.com/kubevela/kubevela/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more details.

## Suggest enhancements

If you have an idea to improve KubeVela, submit an [feature request](https://github.com/kubevela/kubevela/issues/new?assignees=&labels=kind%2Ffeature&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFeature%5D).

## Triage issues

If you don't have the knowledge or time to code, consider helping with _issue triage_. The community will thank you for saving them time by spending some of yours.

Read more about the ways you can [Triage issues](https://github.com/kubevela/community/blob/main/ISSUE_TRIAGE.md).

## Answering questions

If you have a question and you can't find the answer in the [documentation](https://kubevela.io/docs/),
the next step is to ask it on the [github discussion](https://github.com/kubevela/kubevela/discussions).

It's important to us to help these users, and we'd love your help. You can help other KubeVela users by answering [their questions](https://github.com/kubevela/kubevela/discussions).

## Contribute to the Docs

Contributing to the docs needs to learn some knowledge about how to make a pull request to Github, I think this won't be hard if you follow the guide.
