### What is the difference between KubeVela and Helm?

KubeVela is a platform builder tool to create easy-to-use yet extensible app delivery/management systems with Kubernetes. KubeVela relies on Helm as templating engine and package format for apps. But Helm is not the only templating module that KubeVela supports. Another first-class supported approach is CUE. 

Also, KubeVela is by design a Kubernetes controller (i.e. works on server side), even for its Helm part, a Helm operator will be installed.

## Issues

### Error: unable to create new content in namespace cert-manager because it is being terminated

Occasionally you might hit the issue as below. It happens when the last KubeVela release deletion hasn't completed.

```
$ vela install
- Installing Vela Core Chart:
install chart vela-core, version 0.1.0, desc : A Helm chart for Kube Vela core, contains 35 file
Failed to install the chart with error: serviceaccounts "cert-manager-cainjector" is forbidden: unable to create new content in namespace cert-manager because it is being terminated

...
Error: failed to create resource: serviceaccounts "cert-manager-cainjector" is forbidden: unable to create new content in namespace cert-manager because it is being terminated
```

Take a break and try again in a few seconds.

```
$ vela install

### Error: ScopeDefinition exists

Occasionally you might hit the issue as below. It happens when there is an old OAM Kubernetes Runtime release, or you applied `ScopeDefinition` before.

```
$ vela install
  - Installing Vela Core Chart:

```

Delete `ScopeDefinition` "healthscopes.core.oam.dev" and try again.

```
$ kubectl delete ScopeDefinition "healthscopes.core.oam.dev"
scopedefinition.core.oam.dev "healthscopes.core.oam.dev" deleted

### You have reached your pull rate limit

When you look into the logs of Pod kubevela-vela-core and found the issue as below.

```
$ kubectl get pod -n vela-system -l app.kubernetes.io/name=vela-core
NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

```

>Error response from daemon: toomanyrequests: You have reached your pull rate limit. You may increase the limit by

You can use github container registry instead.

```
$ docker pull ghcr.io/oam-dev/kubevela/vela-core:latest
```

### Warning: Namespace cert-manager exists

If you hit the issue as below, an `cert-manager` release might exist whose namespace and RBAC related resource conflict
with KubeVela.

```
$ vela install
- Installing Vela Core Chart:
install chart vela-core, version 0.1.0, desc : A Helm chart for Kube Vela core, contains 35 file

```

Try these steps to fix the problem.

- Delete release `cert-manager`
- Delete namespace `cert-manager`
- Install KubeVela again

```
$ helm delete cert-manager -n cert-manager
release "cert-manager" uninstalled

$ kubectl delete ns cert-manager
namespace "cert-manager" deleted

### How to fix issue: MutatingWebhookConfiguration mutating-webhook-configuration exists?

If you deploy some other services which will apply MutatingWebhookConfiguration mutating-webhook-configuration, installing
KubeVela will hit the issue as below.

```shell
- Installing Vela Core Chart:

```

To fix this issue, please upgrade KubeVela Cli `vela` version to be higher than `v0.2.2` from [KubeVela releases](https://github.com/oam-dev/kubevela/releases).

## Operating

### Autoscale: how to enable metrics server in various Kubernetes clusters?

Operating Autoscale depends on metrics server, so it has to be enabled in various clusters. Please check whether metrics server
is enabled with command `kubectl top nodes` or `kubectl top pods`.

If the output is similar as below, the metrics is enabled.

```shell
$ kubectl top nodes
NAME                     CPU(cores)   CPU%   MEMORY(bytes)   MEMORY%
cn-hongkong.10.0.1.237   288m         7%     5378Mi          78%
cn-hongkong.10.0.1.238   351m         8%     5113Mi          74%

$ kubectl top pods
NAME                          CPU(cores)   MEMORY(bytes)
php-apache-65f444bf84-cjbs5   0m           1Mi
wordpress-55c59ccdd5-lf59d    1m           66Mi
```

Or you have to manually enable metrics server in your Kubernetes cluster.

- ACK (Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes)

Metrics server is already enabled.

- ASK (Alibaba Cloud Serverless Kubernetes)

Metrics server has to be enabled in `Operations/Add-ons` section of [Alibaba Cloud console](https://cs.console.aliyun.com/) as below.

![](./resources/install-metrics-server-in-ASK.jpg)

Please refer to [metrics server debug guide](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/176515.html) if you hit more issue.

- Kind

Install metrics server as below, or you can install the [latest version](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server#installation).

```shell
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/download/v0.3.7/components.yaml
```

Also add the following part under `.spec.template.spec.containers` in the yaml file loaded by `kubectl edit deploy -n kube-system metrics-server`.

Noted: This is just a walk-around, not for production-level use.

```
command:
- /metrics-server
- --kubelet-insecure-tls
```

- MiniKube

Enable it with following command.

```shell
$ minikube addons enable metrics-server
```


Have fun to [set autoscale](./developer-experience-guide/extensions/set-autoscale) on your application.
