title:  Managing Capabilities
---

In KubeVela, developers can install more capabilities (i.e. new component types and traits) from any GitHub repo that contains OAM definition files. We call these GitHub repos as _Capability Centers_. 

KubeVela is able to discover OAM definition files in this repo automatically and sync them to your own KubeVela platform.

## Add a capability center

Add a registry in KubeVela:

```bash
vela registry config my-center https://github.com/oam-dev/catalog/tree/master/registry
```
```console
Successfully configured registry my-center
```

Now, this registry `my-center` is ready to use.

## List capability centers

You are allowed to add more capability centers and list them.

```bash
vela registry ls
```
```console
NAME            URL                                                    
default         oss://registry.kubevela.net/                            
my-center       https://github.com/oam-dev/catalog/tree/master/registry 
```

## [Optional] Remove a capability center

Or, remove one.

```bash
vela registry remove my-center
```

## List all available capabilities in capability center

Or, list all available ComponentDefinition/TraitDefinition in certain registry.

```bash
vela trait --discover --registry=my-center
vela comp --discover --registry=my-center

## Install a capability from capability center

Now let's try to install the new component named `clonesetservice` from `my-center` to your own KubeVela platform.

You need to install OpenKruise first.

```shell
helm install kruise https://github.com/openkruise/kruise/releases/download/v0.7.0/kruise-chart.tgz
```

Install `clonesetservice` component from `my-center`.

```bash
vela comp get clonesetservice --registry=my-center
```

## Use the newly installed capability

Let's check the `clonesetservice` appears in your platform firstly:

```bash
vela components
```
```console
NAME           	NAMESPACE  	WORKLOAD                	DESCRIPTION
clonesetservice	vela-system	clonesets.apps.kruise.io	Describes long-running, scalable, containerized services
               	           	                        	that have a stable network endpoint to receive external
               	           	                        	network traffic from customers. If workload type is skipped
               	           	                        	for any service defined in Appfile, it will be defaulted to
               	           	                        	`webservice` type.
```

Great! Now let's deploy an app via Appfile.

```bash
cat << EOF > vela.yaml
name: testapp
services:
  testsvc:
    type: clonesetservice
    image: crccheck/hello-world
    port: 8000
EOF
```

```bash
vela up
```
```console
Parsing vela appfile ...
Load Template ...

Rendering configs for service (testsvc)...
Writing deploy config to (.vela/deploy.yaml)

Applying application ...
Checking if app has been deployed...
App has not been deployed, creating a new deployment...
Updating:  core.oam.dev/v1alpha2, Kind=HealthScope in default
âœ… App has been deployed ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
    Port forward: vela port-forward testapp
             SSH: vela exec testapp
         Logging: vela logs testapp
      App status: vela status testapp
  Service status: vela status testapp --svc testsvc
```

then you can Get a cloneset in your environment.

```shell
kubectl get clonesets.apps.kruise.io
```
```console
NAME      DESIRED   UPDATED   UPDATED_READY   READY   TOTAL   AGE
testsvc   1         1         1               1       1       46s
```

## Uninstall a capability

> NOTE: make sure no apps are using the capability before uninstalling.

```bash
kubectl delete componentdefinition -n vela-system clonesetservice
```
