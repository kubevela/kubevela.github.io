## Component Revision

You can specify a generated component instance revision with field `spec.components[*].externalRevision` in Application like below: 

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  components:
    - name: express-server
      type: webservice
      externalRevision: express-server-v1
      properties:
        image: stefanprodan/podinfo:4.0.3
```

If the field is not specified, it will generated by the name rule `<component-name>-<revision-number>`.

After the Application created, it will generate a ControllerRevision object for each component.

* Get the revision for component instance

```shell
$ kubectl get controllerrevision -l controller.oam.dev/component=express-server
NAME                CONTROLLER                       REVISION   AGE
express-server-v1   application.core.oam.dev/myapp   1          2m40s
express-server-v2   application.core.oam.dev/myapp   2          2m12s
```

You can specify the component revision for [component rolling update](./traits/rollout).

## Application Revision

When updating an application entity except workflow, KubeVela will create a new revision as a snapshot for this change.

```shell
$ kubectl get apprev -l app.oam.dev/name=myapp
NAME       AGE
myapp-v1   54m
myapp-v2   53m
myapp-v3   18s
```

You can get all the information related with the application in the application revision, including the application spec,
and all related definitions.

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: ApplicationRevision
metadata:
  labels:
    app.oam.dev/app-revision-hash: a74b4a514ba2fc08
    app.oam.dev/name: myapp
  name: myapp-v3
  namespace: default
  ...
spec:
  application:
    apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
    kind: Application
    metadata:
      name: myapp
      namespace: default
      ...
    spec:
      components:
      - name: express-server
        properties:
          image: stefanprodan/podinfo:5.0.3
        type: webservice@v1
     ...
  componentDefinitions:
    webservice:
      apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
      kind: ComponentDefinition
      metadata:
        name: webservice
        namespace: vela-system
        ...
      spec:
        schematic:
          cue:
            ...
  traitDefinitions:
    ...
```

## Live-Diff the `Application`

Live-diff helps you to have a preview of what would change if you're going to upgrade an application without making any changes
to the living cluster.
This feature is extremely useful for serious production deployment, and make the upgrade under control

It basically generates a diff between the specific revision of running instance and the local candidate application.
The result shows the changes (added/modified/removed/no_change) of the application as well as its sub-resources,
such as components and traits.

Assume we're going to upgrade the application like below.

```yaml
# new-app.yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  components:
    - name: express-server
      type: webservice@v1
      properties:
        image: crccheck/hello-world # change the image
```

Run live-diff like this:

```shell
vela live-diff -f new-app.yaml -r myapp-v1
```

`-r` or `--revision` is a flag that specifies the name of a living ApplicationRevision with which you want to compare the updated application.

`-c` or `--context` is a flag that specifies the number of lines shown around a change. The unchanged lines
which are out of the context of a change will be omitted. It's useful if the diff result contains a lot of unchanged content
while you just want to focus on the changed ones.

VelaUX uses database for version record, we also recommend you to use a database instead of relying on Kubernetes etcd for versioning.
