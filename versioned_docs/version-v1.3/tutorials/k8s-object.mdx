title: Kubernetes Objects
---

This section introduces that how you can deploy Kubernetes objects into multi environments and clusters.

KubeVela supports you to render, orchestrate and deploy Kubernetes objects. The common usage type is Deployment+Service. Using customized Workflow, you can deploy an application into multi-cluster in sequence. Hence you'll get to know:

1. Deploy Kubernetes objects.
2. Workflow and its usage.
3. Multi-env/cluster in application delivery.
4. The control loop of application deployment: Rollback, Terminate and Continue.

What's more, you can even distribute existing Kubernetes objects with KubeVela in the following scenarios:

- Copying secrets from the hub cluster into managed clusters.
- Promote deployments from canary clusters into production clusters.
- Using Kubernetes apiserver as the control plane and storing all Kubernetes objects data in external databases. Then dispatch those data into real Kuberenetes managed clusters.


## Before starting

- Prepare a Deployment+Service yaml config resource.

<!-- - For setting up two and more runtime clusters, check out: [Manage Runtime Cluster](./manage-cluster) TODO v1.2-->

## Scheduling and creating Targets

[Target](../getting-started/core-concept#target) defines the namespace in runtime cluster for application delivery. Once Target created, namespace in runtime cluster created accordingly.

Clicking `New Target` into the creating process. Type in necessary Infos as Project, Cluster, Namespace to create. We create targets for 2 clusters. We create targets for 2 clusters. If you only have 1 cluster you can also use its namespaces to create several targets. For now, we at least give it to 3 Targets: 1 for test and 2 for prod environments.

## Creating Kubernetes application

After Target was created, we begin to create an application. Same to [Deploy First Application](../quick-start), we need to submit basic Infos:

(1) Select type: k8s-objects; NOTE that in one application please maintain at most one Workload type of resource, meaning without more than a Deployment or Statefulset.

(2) We schedule two environments, test and prod. Test environment links to the target for dev and prod environment select the other two targets.

(3) Upload your Yaml file. Note that, the name of the resource you specified must not conflict with existing ones. Also, the editor automatically formats the Yaml file.

After above, click `Create` to finish.

## Deploying test environment

![](../resources/app-dashboard.jpg)

Enter the further page, the application has automatically generated 2 environments and 2 workflows. Each environment has its workflow by default. A workflow consists of one or more steps such as `deploy2env`.

Firstly let's switch to the Tab of the test environment, click Deploy on the page. Since we only assigned one target for the test environment, there's one step for workflow. Looking at the status of its execution in the upper-right, it turns green when succeeded. If it shows red means that workflow went into trouble, you can click on the red sign to look through the detailed reason. Fix it accordingly and the deployment will continue to be regained.

After deployment is finished, refresh the list of instances to see Pods. Click for more if Pod shows abnormality.

![](../resources/pod-list.jpg)

As for the test environment, it sure can be updated at any time. When we update the parameters(image, instance), execute the workflow for an upgrade. Note that, choose the workflow for the test environment.

![](../resources/select-workflow.jpg)

## Deploying prod environment

Let's switch to the Tab of the prod environment. It shows that it's not deployed yet. So now you can understand one basic thing for KubeVela, different environments in one application are completely dependant on each other, of each is an individual Application CR.

As we have two targets for the prod environment, it'll execute in sequence. If you hope to set up a manual approval before it gets into the second target, this is where workflow comes in.

![](../resources/app-workflow.jpg)

we can see two generated workflow. Now we click the `Edit` in the workflow of the prod environment, drag out the `suspend` into the board at the right. Set up the configuration you needed.

Then we need to orchestrate their sequence. First disconnect existing steps (by clicking the line + delete button), connect the suspend step in the middle. After editing, you need to click the Save button on the upper right to save.

![](../resources/workflow-edit.jpg)

Back to the page of prod environment, click Deploy.

![](../resources/workflow-suspend.jpg)

Monitoring the status on the upper right. When the first target finished deploying, a window pops up for you to give out a command.

`suspend` has three operations:

- Rollback: the revision reverts to the latest one in history, even with the first Target.
- Terminate: stop the deployment process but it will not change the first Target that already deployed.
- Continue: enter the execution of the next step.

If continued, the deployment goes on. In the list of instances, you can check out all the details.

## Deploy kubernetes objects via CLI.

This is a demo application with a kubernetes objects, the most kubernetes app are consists of Deployment and Service.
There are two policies and three workflow steps, this means deploying the app to two namespaces and waiting for human review after the first step is successful.

```

- About the topology policy, refence: [Topology](../end-user/policies/references#override)
- About the deploy workflow step, refence: [Deploy](../end-user/workflow/built-in-workflow-defs#deploy)

Deploy this application by the following command:

- create the namespace with the name `production` before deploying the application.

```shell
$ vela up -f https://kubevela.io/example/applications/create-namespace.yaml
```

- deploy the demo application.

```shell
$ vela up -f https://kubevela.io/example/applications/app-with-k8s-objects.yaml
```

- review and resume the workflow after the workflow becomes suspended.

```shell
$ vela workflow resume app-with-k8s-objects
```

## Distributed External Kubernetes Objects

> This section requires you to know how to deploy multi-cluster application with policy and workflow first. You can refer to [Multi-cluster Application Delivery](../case-studies/multi-cluster) for details.


### Refer to Existing Kubernetes Objects in Component

To use existing Kubernetes objects in the component, you need to use the `ref-objects` typed component and declare which resources you want to refer to. For example, in the following example, the secret `image-credential-to-copy` in namespace `examples` will be taken as the source object for the component. Then you can use the topology policy to dispatch it into hangzhou clusters.

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: ref-objects-example
  namespace: examples
spec:
  components:
    - name: image-pull-secrets
      type: ref-objects
      properties:
        objects:
          - resource: secret
            name: image-credential-to-copy
  policies:
    - name: topology-hangzhou-clusters
      type: topology
      properties:
        clusterLabelSelector:
          region: hangzhou
```

### Details for the *ref-objects* typed component

The most simple way to specify resources is to directly use `resource: secret` or `resource: deployment` to describe the kind of resources. If no `name` or `labelSelector` is set, the application will try to find the resource with the same name as the component name in the application's namespace. You can also explicitly specify `name` and `namespace` for the target resource as well.

In addition to `name` and `namespace`, you can also specify the `cluster` field to let the application component refer to resources in managed clusters. You can also use the `labelSelector` to select resources in replace of finding resources by names.

In the following example, the application will select all deployments in the *hangzhou-1* cluster inside the *examples* namespace, which matches the desided labels. Then the application will copy these deployments into *hangzhou-2* cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: ref-objects-duplicate-deployments
  namespace: examples
spec:
  components:
    - name: duplicate-deployment
      type: ref-objects
      properties:
        objects:
          - resource: deployment
            cluster: hangzhou-1
            # select all deployment in the `examples` namespace in cluster `hangzhou-1` that matches the labelSelector
            labelSelector:
              need-duplicate: "true"
  policies:
    - name: topology-hangzhou-2
      type: topology
      properties:
        clusters: ["hangzhou-2"]
```

> In some cases, you might want to restrict the scope for the application to access resources. You can set the `--ref-objects-available-scope` to `namespace` or `cluster` in KubeVela controller's bootstrap parameter, to retrict the application to be only able to refer to the resources inside the same namespace or the same cluster.

### Working with Trait

The *ref-objects* typed component can also be used together with traits. The implicit main workload is the first referenced object and trait patch will be applied on it. The following example demonstrate how to set the replica number for the referenced deployment while deploying it in hangzhou clusters.

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: ref-objects-multiple-resources
  namespace: examples
spec:
  components:
    - name: nginx-ref-multiple-resources
      type: ref-objects
      properties:
        objects:
          - resource: deployment
          - resource: service
      traits:
        - type: scaler
          properties:
            replicas: 3
  policies:
    - name: topology-hangzhou-clusters
      type: topology
      properties:
        clusterLabelSelector:
          region: hangzhou
```
