title:  Managing Applications with Kubernetes and OAM 
---

Improving the user experience of Kubernetes and lowering its complexity is one of the most interesting problem.

To solve the problem, typically teams build application platforms with higher level abstractions atop Kubernetes.

But at the meantime, these platforms tend to be “silo systems” since each of them is a closed system.

As result, the application management ecosystem in both Alibaba and the broader community, are highly fragmented.

In this session, we will share how we broke siloes in application management layer by introducting Open Application Model to imrpove interoperability and reusability. The talk is based on real use cases in Alibaba’s web-scale Kubernetes cluster.
