title: Building an Application-centric Kubernetes Platform for Enterprise Scale
---

Over the past several years, Intuit has migrated to Kubernetes running in the public cloud and now has over 1,700 applications and services running on over 270 clusters. Intuit's cloud-native platform has accelerated the development velocity of Intuit's 5,000+ developers while improving performance and reliability and reducing operational overhead.

In this talk, Todd Ekenstam, a Principal Software Engineer in Intuit's Kubernetes platform team, will share details of how Intuit achieved this and lessons learned along the way, and what it means to build an Application-centric Kubernetes Platform. In addition, Todd will demonstrate the Open Application Model and KubeVela and how you can use these open-source tools to implement an application abstraction to improve software engineers' experience using Kubernetes.
